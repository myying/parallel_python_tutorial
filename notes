what is a process/thread?
- monitor processes on linux: &, fg, bg, ps auf, top, send kill/terminate signal

- subprocess
Use subprocess for external commands and programs.

- cpu or io bound tasks
Use multiprocessing for CPU-bound tasks requiring parallel execution.
Use threading for I/O-bound tasks that can benefit from concurrency despite the GIL limitations.

- concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor, ThreadPoolExecutor
Use this to avoid detail implementation of multiprocessing/threading

- mpi4py
Distributed memory (multiple computers in a cluster) can be used to scale up to even larger amount of processors
